# The Life Engine

The life engine is a cellular automaton designed to simulate the long term processes of biological evolution. It allows organisms to eat, reproduce, mutate, and adapt.
Unlike genetic algorithms, the life engine does not manually select the most "fit" organism for some given task, but rather allows true natural selection to 
run its course. Organisms that survive, successfully produce offspring, and out-compete their neighbors naturally propogate througout the environment.


## Cells
A cell can be one of the following types.
### Independent Cells
Independent cells are not part of organisms. 
- Empty - Dark blue, inert.
- Food - Grayish-blue, provides nourishment for organisms.
### Organism Cells
Organism Cells are only found in organisms, and cannot exist on their own in the grid.
- Mouth - Orange, eats food in directly adjacent cells.
- Producer - Green, randomly generates food in directly adjacent empty cells.
- Mover - Light blue, allows the organism to move and rotate randomly.
- Killer - Red, harms organisms in directly adjacent cells (besides itself).

## Organisms
Organisms are structures of cells that eat food, reproduce, and die.
When an organism dies, every cell in the grid that was occupied by a cell in its body will be changed to food.
Their lifespan is calculated by multiplying the number of cells they have by the hyperparameter `Lifespan Multiplier`. They will survive for that many ticks unless killed by another organism.
When touched by a killer cell, an organism will take damage. Once it has taken as much damage as it has cells in its body, it will die. If the hyperparameter `One touch kill` is on, an organism will immediatly die when touched by a killer cell.

## Reproduction
Once an organism has eaten as much food as it has cells in its body, it will attempt to reproduce. 
First, offspring is formed by cloning the current organism and possibly mutating it (see below).
The offspring birth location is then chosen a certain number of cells in a random direction (up, down, left, right). This number is calculated programmatically such that it is far enough away that it can't intersect with it's parent.
Additionally, a random value between 1 and 3 is added to the location to introduce a little variance.
Reproduction can fail if the offspring attempts to occupy non-empty cells, like other organisms and food. If reproduction fails, the food required to produce a child is wasted.

## Mutation
Offspring can mutate their anatomies in 3 different ways: change a cell, lose a cell, or add a cell. Changing a cell sets a random cell to a random type. Losing a cell removes a random cell. Note that this can result in organisms with "gaps" and cells disconnected from the rest of its body. I consider this a feature, not a bug.
To add a cell the organism first selects a cell it already has in its body, then grows a new cell with a random type in a location adjacent to the selected cell.

If an organism mutates, there is a 10% chance that mutation will alter the movement patterns of the organism (see below).

## Movement and Rotation
Organisms with mover cells (light blue) are permitted to move freely about the grid. Only a single mover cell is required and adding more doesn't do anything. By default, an organism selects a random direction and moves one cell per tick in that direction for a certain number of ticks. This number is called "Move range", and it can mutate over time.

Organims can also rotate around a central pivot cell. This cell can never be removed by mutation, though it can change type. Movers rotate randomly when they change direction, and their rotation is not necessarily the same as their movement direction, ie, they aren't always facing the direction they are moving. Offspring of all organisms (including static ones) rotate randomly during reproduction. This rotation can be toggled in the simulation controls.

## How our game works
Before starting the game the user must choose the starting state of the board by placing cells on it.
When clicking the 'Start' button, each group of cells which are adjacent will be initialized as an organism. After that, every 100 milliseconds the board will update with the operations and reproduction of the organisms.
